# Project Plaid

This is Project Plaid, a custom OS.

## Goals

I was a big fan of the Commodore Amiga. It changed computing for me.

Without emulating the Amiga, I want to recapture the joy of using the
Amiga, on more modern hardware.

## Targets

Currently targeting i686. Main development occurs in qemu.

Eventually, a MIPS or ARM target will be added, once I can track down
an ARM or MIPS board with a fully open chipset. Dealing with binary
blobs for drivers / firmware is not an option I want to pursue.
